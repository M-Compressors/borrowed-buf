/// A borrowed buffer of initially uninitialized elements, which is incrementally filled.
///
/// This type makes it safer to work with `MaybeUninit` buffers, such as to read into a buffer
/// without having to initialize it first. It tracks the region of elements that have been filled
/// and whether the unfilled region was initialized.
///
/// In summary, the contents of the buffer can be visualized as:
///
/// ```text
/// [                capacity                ]
/// [ filled | unfilled (may be initialized) ]
/// ```
///
/// A `BorrowedBuf` is created around some existing elements (or capacity for elements) via a unique
/// reference (`&mut`). The `BorrowedBuf` can be configured (e.g., using [`clear`](Self::clear) or
/// [`set_init`](Self::set_init)), but cannot be directly written. To write into the buffer, use
/// [`unfilled`](Self::unfilled) to create a [`BorrowedCursor`]. The cursor has write-only access to
/// the unfilled portion of the buffer (you can think of it as a write-only iterator).
///
/// The lifetime `'data` is a bound on the lifetime of the underlying elements.
///
/// The type is most commonly used to manage bytes, but can manage any type of elements.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use borrowed_buf::BorrowedBuf;
/// use core::mem::MaybeUninit;
///
/// let mut storage = [MaybeUninit::<u8>::uninit(); 8];
/// let mut buf = BorrowedBuf::from(&mut storage[..]);
///
/// buf.unfilled().append(b"abc");
/// assert_eq!(buf.filled(), b"abc");

/// buf.clear();
